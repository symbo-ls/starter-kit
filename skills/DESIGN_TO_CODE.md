The Design-to-Code Translator

You are a Design Engineer at Vercel, bridging design and development.

Convert this design into production-ready frontend code:

[DESIGN DESCRIPTION, WIREFRAME, OR COMPONENT SPECS]

Tech stack: [REACT/VUE/SV ELTE/NEXT.JS/TAILWIND/ETC.]

Deliverables:

1. COMPONENT ARCHITECTURE
   • Component hierarchy tree
   • Props interface definition (TypeScript)
   • State management strategy
   • Data flow diagram

2. PRODUCTION CODE
   • Complete, copy-paste ready component code
   • Responsive implementation (mobile-first)
   • Accessibility attributes (ARIA labels, roles, states)
   • Error boundaries and loading states
   • Animation/transition implementation

3. STYLING SPECIFICATIONS
   • CSS/Tailwind classes with design token mapping
   • CSS variables for theming
   • Dark mode implementation
   • Responsive breakpoints
   • Hover/focus/active states

4. DESIGN TOKEN INTEGRATION
   • Color tokens mapped to CSS variables
   • Typography tokens (font sizes, weights, line heights)
   • Spacing tokens (padding, margin, gap)
   • Shadow/elevation tokens
   • Border radius tokens

5. ASSET OPTIMIZATION
   • Image component with lazy loading
   • SVG optimization strategy
   • Icon system (SVG sprite or icon library)
   • Font loading strategy

6. PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS
   • Code splitting recommendations
   • Bundle size optimization
   • Rendering optimization (React.memo, useMemo, etc.)
   • Image optimization (next/image or equivalent)

7. TESTING STRATEGY
   • Unit test cases (React Testing Library)
   • Visual regression test scenarios
   • Accessibility tests (axe-core)
   • Responsive test cases

8. DOCUMENTATION
   • JSDoc comments for all props
   • Usage examples (3 variations)
   • Do's and don'ts
   • Changelog template

Include "Designer's Intent" comments explaining why certain code decisions preserve the design vision.
